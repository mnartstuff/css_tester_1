		<h1>Testing the waters of CSS</h1>
		<p id="header_text"> This is the header text of my website to experiment with CSS. I am interested in the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Text color</li>
			<li>Background color</li>
			<li>Test size</li>
			<li>Font</li>
			<li>Font Style</li>
			<li>Text position</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>This will be my first section</h3>
		<p>Not sure what this section is about. It could about anything. It's the first of probably several sections. I don't know- I haven't made any other sections yet. I'm just winging it, even though we're advised to plan out our websites on paper before we start.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Second section</h3>
		<p>I'm adding a second section here. It'll be about something other than the first section, otherwise there would be no need for a second section.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Third section</h3>
		<p>I think this will be the last section I make as a simple paragraph. The next section will be a navigation menu. That will be another section, but different from this section and the two previous sections.</p>
