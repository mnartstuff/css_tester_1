			You haven't had tasted deeeeeee-licious until you've had Alexandra's 
			extra-yummy, extra-chocolatey cookies. Each one is hand-made with
			love and tenderness, and is not-quite-but-almost as sweet as she is,
			 which is pretty darned sweet, since she is the sweetest chick in
			 the whole wide galaxy. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="cookies">
			Every time she bakes her cookies, it's an exciting time to be alive.
			I like to tell my brother what she's up to because it makes him
			jealous. One time, she send the two of us cookies in the post when we
			were in New Hampshire. They arrived in crumbs, but we ate those and
			they were great.
